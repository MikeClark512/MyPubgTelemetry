# MyPubgTelemetry
This project is new and in development, and as such, not very useful or well-organized. 

## Instructions
Paste your PUBG API key into data/APIKEY.txt so that the program can read it and use it while accessing PUBG APIs.
You'd have to edit the source code and recompile to change the username.
Telemetry data is stored in C:/TEMP/telemetry-XYZ.json.gz.

## Plans for the Future
Eventually the program will allow incremental (e.g. daily) downloading and aggregating of telemetry data for a list of preset users (e.g. you and your friends). 
Fascinating statitics in beautiful reports can be generated from the aggregate statistics.
